# Safety and Weight Distribution in Rooftop Gardening üõ°Ô∏è

Before placing anything on your rooftop, safety comes first. Improper planning can lead to water damage, leaks, or worse ‚Äî structural strain.

## üèóÔ∏è Weight Considerations
- Limit to **150‚Äì200 kg per sq. meter** (consult a civil engineer if unsure)
- Use **lightweight containers** (grow bags, HDPE bins)
- Choose **light soil mix**: 50% cocopeat, 30% compost, 20% perlite/sand

## üí¶ Water Drainage
- Ensure your roof has **proper slope and drainage** to prevent stagnation
- Elevate pots slightly to allow airflow and drainage

## üîí Wind & Stability
- Use **wind barriers** (netting or fencing)
- Avoid tall or top-heavy plants unless supported

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Legal/HOA Checks
- Get **permission** from housing society or owner (if rented)
- Ensure no structural changes are made without approval
