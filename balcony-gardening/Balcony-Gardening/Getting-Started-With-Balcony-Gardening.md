# Getting Started with Balcony Gardening 🌿

Balcony gardening is a powerful way to grow your own food in limited space. Even a few pots can yield herbs, vegetables, or microgreens — boosting your health, cutting grocery costs, and giving you control over what you consume.

##  Why Start?
- You control the quality of your food
- You reduce dependency on commercial supply chains
- It’s therapeutic and rewarding
- Saves money and supports sustainability

## What You'll Need
- 4–5 containers or pots (plastic, clay, or grow bags)
- Organic potting mix or compost
- Seeds or saplings (tomato, chili, mint, etc.)
- Watering can or spray bottle
- Basic tools (spoon, gloves, small fork)

## Ideal Plants for Beginners
- **Herbs:** Mint, basil, coriander
- **Vegetables:** Tomato, chili, spinach
- **Microgreens:** Mustard, radish, fenugreek

## Sunlight Requirements
Minimum 3–4 hours of sunlight daily. South or east-facing balconies work best.

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes to Avoid
- Overwatering your plants
- Using soil with poor drainage
- Starting without understanding the plant’s needs
