# Soil and Container Tips for Balcony Gardening 🪴

Soil and container choices make or break your urban farming success. Here’s how to set yourself up right from day one.

## 🏺 Choosing the Right Containers
- Use **containers with drainage holes** to prevent root rot
- Choose **lightweight pots** for high-rise balconies (plastic, grow bags)
- Avoid metal containers — they heat up and stress roots

## 🧱 Container Sizes
- Herbs: 6–8 inch pots
- Leafy greens: 10–12 inch wide, 6 inch deep
- Tomatoes/chilies: 12–14 inch deep pots

## 🌱 Ideal Soil Mix (well-draining + nutrient-rich)
